           <h2 class="c">Who Am I?</h2><br><p>Hello, I’m Joseph Burns, a senior at BHS, and welcome to my Capstone project. My capstone topic is the development and history of computer programming languages.</p><br><h2 class="c">What is a Computer Programming Language?</h2><br><p>Computer programming languages include basically any way of telling a computer what to do, and can be anything from basically human readable instructions to raw binary, otherwise known as 1s and 0s. Newer programming languages often look similar to English with words like “if”, “and”, “not”,  etc. which are easier to understand.</p><br><div class="ic"><img src="images/whatis.png" alt="what is programming image"></div><h2 class="c">Why Did I Choose This Topic?</h2><br><p> 
I am interested in this topic because I have a lot of experience in programming, as well as I plan to study programming for a career. My driving question was, How have computer programming languages evolved over time since their inception to today?</p>

        <div class="hiddiv" id="t2" hidden><h2 class="c">Compiled vs. Interpreted</h2><br><p>With all these new programming languages around, which of them is actually the fastest? Computers work by converting code to something that it can understand, which can either be done before or after the program is ran. This is important because it makes certain languages are not as capable as others at being fast because of the different ways they work. If a language is compiled then it is capable of being almost as fast as possible, but if it is interpreted then it is speed capped by the interpreter.</p><br><div class="ic"><img src="images/compvint.png" alt="compiled vs interpreted"></div><h2 class="c">The Obvious Answer</h2><br><p>According to the article <i>Computer Programming Languages</i>, by Donald Shirer, from the Salem Press Encyclopedia of Science, "Since assembly language offers the most control over the computer and its memory storage, it is used for tasks where the utmost in execution in speed or or data efficiency is needed. It takes considerable experience, patience, and self-discipline to write a large program in assembly language…"</p><br><h2 class="c">Conclusions</h2><br><p>Ultimately, any language that is compiled and doesn’t have any major speed handicaps, like C or Rust, can be practically considered the fastest practical programming language.</p></div>
        <div class="hiddiv" id="t3" hidden><p>So, with all of these developments made to programming languages, what jobs have been created? Within the past 3 decades, many jobs have sprung up out of computer science, here are a few examples.
</p><br><h2 class="c">Web Programmers</h2><br><p> 
One of the main types of programming done today is web development. According to the article 11 Types of Programming Jobs from Indeed, "Web developers design and create websites. They're responsible for both how the site looks and how it functions. They test and evaluate a site to make sure it meets quality standards before its release. After the site gets published, web developers monitor the site's continued performance and troubleshoot any technical problems that might arise. They ensure that their websites and programs meet current security standards." 
</p><br><div class="ic"><img src="images/html.png" alt="some html code"><br></div><h2 class="c">Data Scientists</h2><br><p>
Along with web programming, the article also said that, "A data scientist uses technology to collect, organize, evaluate and interpret large or complex sets of data. Data scientists often develop complex algorithms designed to help their clients gain the most relevant insights into their clients or business operations. Data scientist duties can vary depending on their industry. For instance, while a data scientist at a government agency might primarily analyze data related to political opinions, a data scientist in social media may spend the majority of their time evaluating metrics like click-through or share rates."
